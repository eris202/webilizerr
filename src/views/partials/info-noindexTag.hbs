<li class="mx-2 question" data-title="No Index Tag" data-info="The noindex directive is an often used value in a meta tag that can be added to the HTML source code of a 
webpage to suggest to search engines (most notably Google) to not include that particular page in its list of search results.
By default, a webpage is set to 'index.' You should add a meta name='robots' content='noindex' directive to a webpage
    in the 'head' section of the HTML if you do not want search engines to crawl a given page and include it in the
SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages).">
